# First Year Robot Project
For my first year Embedded Systems module, an ultrasound controlled robot was created to complete given tasks. <br />
<br />
Task 1 required the robot to travel in a straight line for two meters, using encoders calculate the distance and keep within the limits of a single lane 0.35m wide. <br />
A demonstration of task 1 can be viewed by watching the Task1.mp4 video.<br />
<br />
For task 2 the robot was to complete a lap around a box of 1.25m x 1.25m, then rest in a landing square in the middle of the box - all within 60 seconds.<br />
A demonstration of this task can be viewed by watching the Task2.mp4 video.<br />
<br />
NB: Due to the circumstances surronding the Covid-19 pandemic, the some of the task parameters were modified (i.e. size of the lane and the box).
